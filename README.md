# CS50 example programs

Clone this repo so you have a local copy:

```bash
cd ~/cs50-dev
git clone git@github.com:cs50dartmouth/examples.git
```

To update, any time, `cd examples` and `git pull`.

**Do not edit the files in your local copy;** such changes may be overwritten (or conflict with) changes made by the instructor. 
You are encouraged to play with these examples, but it's better to work in your own copy.

If, for some reason you edit one of these files and want to "reset" to the copy in the repo,  `git checkout` *filename*  will restore the original.
